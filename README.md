# TENSORFUZZ
What is the fuss about TensorFuzz?
It is the fun automated software “testing” for neural networks, 
adapting traditional coverage guided fuzzing techniques.
Run #TensorFuzz to take your test coverage to levels other methods cannot reach (e.g. activation coverage, not just class coverage)

Great work by Augustus Odena and @Ian Goodfellow
